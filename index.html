                    <h3>i'm jeii and i am a developer</h3>
                    <p>I am a passionate aspiring full-stack software developer with a strong enthusiasm for technology
                        and
                        its limitless possibilities. My expertise spans both front-end technologies like React and
                        back-end
                        development with Java and its frameworks, such as Spring Boot.

                        One of the most valuable lessons I've learned in my journey is the importance of continuous
                        learning. I thrive on staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the software
                        development field. This allows me to adapt quickly and efficiently to the ever-changing tech
                        landscape.

                        I'm proud of my portfolio, which includes a diverse range of projects showcasing my
                        problem-solving
                        skills and creativity in both front-end and back-end development. Through internships and
                        collaborations, I've gained valuable teamwork experience, appreciating the significance of
                        collective effort in software development.

                        Beyond coding, I enjoy photography, hiking, and brewing the perfect cup of coffee. Let's connect
                        and
                        explore the endless potential of full-stack development together.</p>
